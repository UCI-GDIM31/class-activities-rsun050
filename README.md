Write your W1 activity Devlog here. <a style="font-size:70%"><- ok</a>

<b style="font-size:120%">Prompt: In the Hierarchy, move the Camera off of the Cat GameObject, so that itâ€™s no longer a child of the Cat. What happens when you run the game now, and why?</b>

The cat moves, but the camera stays still. Since the camera is no longer a 'child object' of the cat, so their positions are not connected.
